# come play cat merge!!
Hello folks, this is my second ever solo project (kinda)! I made a 2048 game following a tutorial but adding my own graphics and win/lose system which better tracks if you actually lost. 


## oct 31 2025
This is the incomplete version without the cat merge, but the 2048 is functioning and playable. For now, it is just a number merging basic 2048. 
### tutorial

To play, you can either use the arrow keys. The goal is to merge the same cat icons together until you get a cooler more awesome cat icon. This is also going to be unplayable on mobile, so just like, don't play it on mobile (i'll make something for mobile at one point gang trust)

The goal is to get to 2048, or in this case, golden cat. You can still keep playing after it though. You lose if there are no more moves left. 

#### was this hard? struggles? why???
I'm making a 2048 inspired game cuz I thought it'd be easy (guh??) but I still managed to struggle even with tutorials??? if you check lost.js, you can see my attempt at making this game in kaplay before failing miserably and switching to JS. Despite technically being from a tutorial, I did try to add my own spin to the code, colors, etc. In the end, even with how much I struggled (i was debugging for like 20 minutes until i figured out i wrote "1" instead of "i"), this was a great learning exprience and I had a lot of fun. 

#### art!!
this art is all made by me minus background (i unfortunately cannot find where i got it??)

#### footnote and other
I am currently crunching this in for Athena Award 1 day before everything is due. I'm extremely cooked and I lowkey hate myself for procrastinating this long (i didnt code ALL OF SEPTEMBER + OCTOBER (besides daydream but still)). I'm really thankful for the opportunity that athena has given me! I really did enjoy this despite the burnout midway and I hope to participate in even more hack clubs in the future.
